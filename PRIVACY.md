# Privacy Policy

By downloading and using KA.live you agree to this Privacy Policy. It may change without notice, and by continuing to use the application you agree to the changes.

## What is collected

KA.live has three components that process and store data.

The **local app** on your device stores your favorite stops and settings.

The **API gateway** receives requests for nearby stops (including your current location) and for current depatures (including the stop's identifier).
It forwards the request to KVV's TRIAS API and returns the response to your device.
It does not store any request or response data.

Finally, **KVV's TRIAS API** receives your current location and the identifiers of any stops you request the departures for from the API gateway.
Visit [KVV's privacy policy](https://www.kvv.de/unternehmen/rechtliche-hinweise/datenschutzbestimmungen.html) for information on how they process data.
